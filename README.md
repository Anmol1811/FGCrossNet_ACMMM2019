# A New Benchmark and Approach for Fine-grained Cross-media Retrieval

# Introduction
This is our forked repo of the original project. This is the source code of the baseline model. 
We are currently trying to get all the required files and fix errors we found in the original repository (Since the data provided to us was not exactly same as the original dataset on which model was trained and tested) and to run the pre-trained model on the dataset.
